# SpecKit Implementation Guide for Agno Agent Demo Project

## Overview

This guide provides comprehensive instructions for implementing **SpecKit** (Spec-Driven Development) in your Agno Agent Demo project. SpecKit enables specification-driven development, allowing you to focus on product scenarios by generating executable specifications and implementations.

## What is SpecKit?

SpecKit is a tool that enables **Spec-Driven Development**, transforming simple feature descriptions into complete implementation plans and executable tasks. It focuses on the "what" and "why" of applications, then generates the "how" through structured planning.

## Prerequisites

### System Requirements
- **Python 3.11+**
- **uv** (Python package installer)
- **Git**
- **PowerShell** (Windows) or **Bash** (Linux/macOS)

### Installation

1. **Install SpecKit CLI globally:**
```powershell
uv tool install specify-cli --from git+https://github.com/github/spec-kit.git
```

2. **Verify installation:**
```powershell
specify --help
specify check
```

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Initialize SpecKit in Your Existing Project

Since you already have an established Agno Agent Demo project, we'll integrate SpecKit into your existing structure:

#### Option A: Initialize SpecKit in Current Directory
```powershell
# Navigate to your project root
cd d:\work\agent-demo

# Initialize SpecKit with GitHub Copilot (recommended for your setup)
specify init --here --ai copilot --force

# This will create:
# - .specify/ directory with configuration
# - scripts/ directory with automation scripts
# - specs/ directory for feature specifications
```

#### Option B: Create a SpecKit-Enhanced Version
```powershell
# Create a new enhanced version
specify init agent-demo-speckit --ai copilot
cd agent-demo-speckit

# Copy your existing code
# Then follow the migration steps below
```

### Phase 2: Establish Project Constitution

Create project principles using SpecKit's constitution feature:

```powershell
# In your AI agent (GitHub Copilot Chat)
/speckit.constitution Create principles focused on:
- AI agent development best practices
- Agno framework integration patterns
- Code quality and testing standards for AI agents
- Performance requirements for real-time agent interactions
- Security considerations for AI model integrations
- Modular architecture for different agent types (basic, tools, reasoning, memory)
```

This creates `.specify/memory/constitution.md` with your project's governing principles.

### Phase 3: Convert Existing Features to Specifications

#### 3.1 Basic Agent Feature
```powershell
# Create specification for basic agent
/speckit.specify Build a conversational AI agent using the Agno framework that supports both Azure OpenAI and regular OpenAI models. The agent should provide clear, accurate responses with markdown formatting and datetime context. Include interactive chat loop with graceful error handling and environment variable configuration.
```

#### 3.2 Agent with Tools Feature
```powershell
# Create specification for tools agent
/speckit.specify Build an AI agent with web search capabilities using DuckDuckGo integration. The agent should be able to search the web, process search results, and provide informed responses based on real-time information. Include proper tool integration patterns and search result formatting.
```

#### 3.3 Reasoning Agent Feature
```powershell
# Create specification for reasoning agent
/speckit.specify Build a reasoning AI agent that performs step-by-step problem analysis with structured thinking. The agent should break down complex problems, show reasoning steps, provide logical analysis, and present solutions in a clear, structured format.
```

#### 3.4 Memory Agent Feature
```powershell
# Create specification for memory agent
/speckit.specify Build an AI agent with persistent memory capabilities across conversations. The agent should store and retrieve conversation history, maintain context across sessions, and provide personalized responses based on previous interactions.
```

### Phase 4: Generate Technical Plans

For each feature specification, create detailed technical implementation plans:

#### 4.1 Basic Agent Technical Plan
```powershell
/speckit.plan The basic agent uses Agno framework with configurable OpenAI/Azure OpenAI models. Use python-dotenv for environment management, implement model configuration abstraction, include comprehensive error handling, and provide user-friendly CLI interface. Maintain compatibility with existing agent.py structure.
```

#### 4.2 Multi-Agent System Plan
```powershell
/speckit.plan The multi-agent system uses Agno framework with FastAPI for web interface, WebSocket for real-time communication, and modular architecture for different agent types. Implement agent orchestration, shared knowledge base, and scalable deployment patterns. Use existing examples/ directory structure as foundation.
```

### Phase 5: Generate Executable Tasks

Break down implementation into actionable tasks:

```powershell
# For each feature specification
/speckit.tasks

# This creates tasks.md files with specific implementation steps
```

## Project Structure Integration

SpecKit will enhance your existing structure:

## Workflow Integration

### Development Workflow with SpecKit

1. **Feature Planning:**
   ```powershell
   # Define what you want to build
   /speckit.specify [feature description]
   
   # Generate technical plan
   /speckit.plan [technical approach]
   
   # Break into tasks
   /speckit.tasks
   ```

2. **Implementation:**
   ```powershell
   # Execute implementation plan
   implement specs/[feature-number]/plan.md
   ```

3. **Quality Gates:**
   - Simplicity Gate: ≤3 projects
   - Anti-Abstraction Gate: Use frameworks directly
   - Integration-First Gate: Contract tests before implementation

### File Creation Order (Test-First Development)

1. Create `contracts/` with API specifications
2. Create test files: contract → integration → e2e → unit
3. Create source files to make tests pass

## Enhanced Project Features

### 1. Automated Documentation
- Feature specifications automatically generated
- Technical plans with architecture decisions
- Task breakdowns for implementation
- Research notes for technology choices

### 2. Quality Assurance
- Pre-implementation gates
- Test-first development enforced
- Architecture principles validation
- Requirement completeness checks

### 3. Agent Orchestration
Using SpecKit's structured approach for multi-agent systems:

```powershell
/speckit.specify Build a multi-agent orchestration system where different specialized agents (basic, tools, reasoning, memory) can collaborate on complex tasks. Include agent communication protocols, task delegation, and result aggregation. Support dynamic agent selection based on task requirements.
```

### 4. Knowledge Base Integration
```powershell
/speckit.specify Integrate a knowledge base system that allows agents to store, retrieve, and share learned information across conversations and agent types. Include vector database integration, semantic search, and knowledge persistence.
```

## Advanced SpecKit Commands

### Research and Analysis
```powershell
# Research specific technologies
/speckit.plan Research best practices for Agno framework integration patterns, AI agent performance optimization, and production deployment strategies for AI agents.
```

### Architecture Validation
```powershell
# Validate architectural decisions
/speckit.constitution Review and validate that the current architecture aligns with Agno framework best practices and AI agent development principles.
```

## Migration Strategy

### Step 1: Backup Current Project
```powershell
# Create backup
cp -r agent-demo agent-demo-backup
```

### Step 2: Initialize SpecKit
```powershell
cd agent-demo
specify init --here --ai copilot --force
```

### Step 3: Create Specifications for Existing Features
Follow Phase 3 above to create specs for your existing features.

### Step 4: Enhance Implementation
Use generated plans and tasks to improve your existing code structure.
