# Memory Agent Specification

## Feature Overview
Build an AI agent with persistent memory capabilities across conversations. The agent stores and retrieves conversation history, maintains context across sessions, and provides personalized responses based on previous interactions. Uses SQLite database for local storage with agentic memory control.

## User Stories
- As a user, I want the agent to remember our previous conversations
- As a user, I want personalized responses based on my interaction history
- As a user, I want the agent to refer to past conversations when relevant
- As a developer, I want persistent storage that works across application restarts
- As a user, I want the agent to ask clarifying questions based on what it knows about me
- As a user, I want my conversation history to be stored securely and locally
- As a developer, I want memory management that doesn't impact performance

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Agent integrates SQLite database for persistent memory storage
- [ ] Agentic memory is enabled (enable_agentic_memory=True) for intelligent memory control
- [ ] Conversation history persists across application sessions
- [ ] Agent references previous conversations when contextually relevant
- [ ] Important user information is stored and recalled appropriately
- [ ] Memory queries don't significantly impact response time
- [ ] Database file is created and managed automatically
- [ ] Agent asks clarifying questions based on stored context
- [ ] Memory storage respects privacy and data retention principles
- [ ] Memory system handles database errors gracefully

## Technical Requirements
- **Framework**: Agno framework with SQLite database integration
- **Database**: SqliteDb with local file storage (agent_memory.db)
- **Memory**: Agentic memory enabled for intelligent memory management
- **Storage**: Persistent conversation history and user context
- **Performance**: Efficient memory queries with minimal latency impact
- **Security**: Local storage with appropriate data protection
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of database connection issues
- **Logging**: Memory operations logging for debugging and analysis

## Success Metrics
- SQLite database integration works without configuration issues
- Conversation history persists across application restarts (100% retention)
- Agent successfully references previous conversations when relevant
- Memory queries complete within reasonable time (under 1 second)
- Important user information is accurately stored and retrieved
- Database operations don't cause conversation interruptions
- Memory storage is efficient and doesn't grow unbounded
- Privacy requirements are met for local data storage
- Code coverage >80% for memory integration logic

## Dependencies
- agno: AI agent framework with memory support
- agno.db.sqlite: SQLite database integration for memory
- python-dotenv: Environment configuration
- sqlite3: SQLite database operations (via Agno)

## Memory Patterns
- **Conversation History**: Full conversation thread persistence
- **User Context**: Important user information and preferences
- **Contextual Recall**: Intelligent retrieval of relevant past interactions
- **Memory Queries**: Efficient search and retrieval from stored data
- **Data Lifecycle**: Appropriate retention and cleanup policies
- **Privacy Controls**: User control over memory storage and deletion

## Non-Functional Requirements
- **Persistence**: Data survives application restarts and system reboots
- **Performance**: Memory operations don't significantly impact response time
- **Scalability**: Memory system handles growing conversation history efficiently
- **Security**: Local data storage with appropriate protection measures
- **Privacy**: User control over what is remembered and stored
- **Reliability**: Database operations are atomic and consistent
- **Maintainability**: Clear separation between memory logic and agent behavior
