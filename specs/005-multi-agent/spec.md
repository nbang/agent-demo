# Feature Specification: Multi-Agent Collaboration System

**Feature Branch**: `005-multi-agent-example`  
**Created**: October 16, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "multi agent example (005-multi-agent)"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Research Team Collaboration (Priority: P1)

A user wants to conduct comprehensive research on a complex topic by having multiple AI agents work together, where each agent specializes in different aspects (web research, analysis, synthesis) and collaborates to produce a comprehensive research report.

**Why this priority**: This is the most fundamental multi-agent use case that demonstrates core collaboration patterns and provides immediate value for research tasks.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by requesting research on any topic (e.g., "Research the impact of AI on healthcare") and receiving a structured report with sources, analysis, and conclusions from multiple specialized agents.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user provides a research topic, **When** they request a research report, **Then** multiple agents collaborate to gather information, analyze findings, and produce a comprehensive report with sources
2. **Given** agents are working on research, **When** one agent finds relevant information, **Then** it is automatically shared with other agents for analysis and synthesis
3. **Given** research is complete, **When** the final report is generated, **Then** it includes contributions from all agents with clear attribution and structured formatting

### User Story 2 - Content Creation Team (Priority: P2)

A user wants to create comprehensive content (blog posts, documentation, presentations) by having specialized agents collaborate on different aspects like research, writing, editing, and formatting.

**Why this priority**: Content creation is a common business need that benefits significantly from specialized agent collaboration and demonstrates workflow orchestration.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by requesting content creation on any topic and receiving polished, well-structured content that shows evidence of multiple specialized contributions.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a content topic and requirements, **When** the user requests content creation, **Then** research agents gather information while writing agents create drafts and editing agents refine the output
2. **Given** content is being created, **When** agents identify conflicting information, **Then** they collaborate to resolve inconsistencies and provide accurate content
3. **Given** content creation is complete, **When** the final output is delivered, **Then** it meets quality standards for structure, accuracy, and readability

---

### User Story 3 - Problem-Solving Team (Priority: P3)

A user presents a complex problem that benefits from multiple perspectives, and different agents approach it from various angles (technical, business, user experience) to provide comprehensive solutions.

**Why this priority**: Problem-solving demonstrates advanced multi-agent reasoning and provides value for complex decision-making scenarios.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by presenting a multi-faceted problem and receiving solution recommendations from different perspectives with clear reasoning from each agent.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a complex problem description, **When** the user requests solution analysis, **Then** agents with different specializations analyze the problem from their perspectives
2. **Given** agents are analyzing a problem, **When** they identify solution options, **Then** they collaborate to evaluate trade-offs and provide ranked recommendations
3. **Given** solution analysis is complete, **When** recommendations are presented, **Then** they include implementation considerations from all relevant perspectives

### Edge Cases

- What happens when agents reach conflicting conclusions during collaboration?
- How does the system handle scenarios where one agent fails or becomes unresponsive?
- What occurs when the collaboration task requires more time than expected?
- How are resource conflicts managed when multiple agents need the same external resources?
- What happens when user requirements change mid-collaboration?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST support multiple AI agents working collaboratively on shared tasks
- **FR-002**: System MUST enable agents to communicate and share information with each other during task execution
- **FR-003**: System MUST provide agent specialization capabilities where each agent has distinct roles and expertise areas
- **FR-004**: System MUST orchestrate agent workflows to ensure logical task sequencing and coordination
- **FR-005**: System MUST present collaborative results in a structured format showing contributions from each agent
- **FR-006**: System MUST handle agent failures gracefully without compromising the overall collaborative task
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide visibility into the collaboration process with status updates and progress tracking
- **FR-008**: System MUST support configurable collaboration patterns for different types of tasks
- **FR-009**: System MUST enable users to specify collaboration requirements and constraints
- **FR-010**: System MUST validate that collaborative outputs meet quality standards before delivery

### Key Entities

- **Multi-Agent Team**: A coordinated group of AI agents working together on shared objectives with defined roles and communication patterns
- **Agent Role**: A specialization definition that determines an agent's capabilities, knowledge focus, and responsibilities within the collaboration
- **Collaboration Workflow**: The orchestrated sequence of agent interactions and task handoffs required to complete complex objectives
- **Shared Context**: Information and state that is accessible to all agents in a collaboration for coordination and consistency
- **Agent Communication**: The mechanism by which agents exchange information, updates, and coordinate their activities
- **Task Assignment**: The process of distributing work among agents based on their roles and current capacity
- **Collaborative Output**: The integrated result of multiple agents working together, combining their individual contributions into cohesive deliverables

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Users can initiate multi-agent collaborations for research tasks and receive comprehensive reports within 5 minutes for standard topics
- **SC-002**: Collaborative outputs demonstrate clear contributions from at least 2-3 specialized agents working in coordination
- **SC-003**: 90% of multi-agent tasks complete successfully without requiring manual intervention or error recovery
- **SC-004**: Users report higher satisfaction with collaborative results compared to single-agent outputs for complex tasks
- **SC-005**: System handles collaboration workflows for teams of 3-5 agents without performance degradation
- **SC-006**: Agent communication and coordination overhead represents less than 20% of total task execution time
- **SC-007**: 95% of collaborative sessions maintain consistent context and avoid contradictory outputs between agents
