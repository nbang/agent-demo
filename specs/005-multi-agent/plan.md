# Implementation Plan: Multi-Agent Collaboration System

**Branch**: `005-multi-agent` | **Date**: October 16, 2025 | **Spec**: [spec.md](spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/005-multi-agent/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

Primary requirement: Build a multi-agent collaboration system where specialized AI agents work together on complex tasks like research, content creation, and problem-solving. Technical approach will leverage the Agno framework's Agent and Team classes to coordinate multiple agents with distinct roles, shared context, and workflow orchestration.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Python 3.11+ (matches existing project)  
**Primary Dependencies**: Agno framework, existing project dependencies (OpenAI/Azure OpenAI)  
**Storage**: NEEDS CLARIFICATION - Shared state management for multi-agent coordination  
**Testing**: pytest (matches existing project testing framework)  
**Target Platform**: Cross-platform Python (Windows/Linux/macOS)
**Project Type**: Single project (extends existing agent-demo structure)  
**Performance Goals**: Agent collaboration within 5 minutes for research tasks, <20% coordination overhead  
**Constraints**: 90% success rate without manual intervention, support 3-5 agent teams  
**Scale/Scope**: Research teams, content creation teams, problem-solving teams with specialized agent roles

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

### Core Principles Compliance
- âœ… **Agno Framework First**: Will use Agno Agent and Team classes for multi-agent coordination
- âœ… **Multi-Model Support**: Will inherit existing OpenAI/Azure OpenAI configuration
- âœ… **Test-First Development**: TDD approach with contract tests before implementation
- âœ… **Modular Agent Architecture**: Multi-agent teams as independent, testable modules
- âœ… **Real-Time Performance Standards**: Target <5 minutes for research tasks, <20% overhead

### Security Requirements Compliance
- âœ… **API Key Management**: Uses existing environment variable configuration
- âœ… **Model Safety**: Inherits existing content filtering and safety measures
- âœ… **Data Privacy**: Agent collaboration data handled with privacy best practices

### Quality Standards Compliance
- âœ… **Simplicity Gate**: Uses â‰¤3 dependencies (Agno + existing project deps)
- âœ… **Anti-Abstraction Gate**: Direct use of Agno framework without unnecessary abstractions
- âœ… **Integration-First Gate**: Contract tests before implementation
- âœ… **Performance Gate**: Measurable performance targets defined in spec
- âœ… **Security Gate**: Inherits existing security validation

**GATE STATUS: PASS** - All constitutional requirements can be met with proposed approach

**Structure Decision**: Extends existing single project structure by adding multi-agent collaboration capabilities as a new module under `src/agents/multi_agent/`. This maintains consistency with existing agent implementations while providing dedicated space for team coordination logic. The structure leverages existing examples directory for enhanced demonstrations and follows established testing patterns.
