# Research Phase: Multi-Agent Collaboration System

**Feature**: Multi-Agent Collaboration System  
**Phase**: 0 - Outline & Research  
**Date**: October 16, 2025

## Research Tasks

Based on NEEDS CLARIFICATION items identified in the Technical Context, the following research is required:

### Task 1: Shared State Management for Multi-Agent Coordination

**Research Question**: What storage mechanism should be used for managing shared state between collaborating agents?

**Findings**:

**Decision**: Use Agno's built-in shared memory and session management with optional SQLite persistence

**Rationale**: 
- Agno framework provides built-in session and conversation management
- SQLite can be used for persistent shared context when needed (following memory agent pattern)
- In-memory shared state for real-time collaboration coordination
- Leverages existing patterns from memory agent implementation

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Redis for shared state: Rejected due to adding external dependency complexity
- File-based coordination: Rejected due to concurrency and performance concerns
- Custom database schema: Rejected due to duplicating Agno's capabilities

### Task 2: Agent Communication Patterns in Agno Framework

**Research Question**: What are the best practices for inter-agent communication using the Agno framework?

**Findings**:

**Decision**: Use Agno Team class with agent-to-agent message passing and shared context

**Rationale**:
- Agno Team class is designed specifically for multi-agent coordination
- Built-in message passing between team members
- Shared context automatically managed across team agents
- Event-driven communication for real-time collaboration

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Direct agent method calls: Rejected due to tight coupling
- External message queue: Rejected due to complexity and external dependencies
- File-based communication: Rejected due to performance limitations

### Task 3: Agent Role Specialization Implementation

**Research Question**: How should agent roles and specializations be implemented within the Agno framework?

**Findings**:

**Decision**: Use Agent instruction specialization with role-specific tool configurations

**Rationale**:
- Each agent gets specialized instructions defining their role and expertise
- Different agents can have different tool configurations (e.g., research agents get web search tools)
- Role-based prompt engineering for specialized behavior
- Leverages existing agent architecture patterns from the project

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Inheritance-based specialization: Rejected due to constitution's anti-abstraction principle
- Plugin architecture: Rejected due to unnecessary complexity
- External configuration files: Rejected due to maintenance overhead

### Task 4: Workflow Orchestration Patterns

**Research Question**: What patterns should be used for orchestrating multi-agent workflows?

**Findings**:

**Decision**: Implement workflow orchestration using Team leader pattern with sequential and parallel task execution

**Rationale**:
- Team leader agent coordinates workflow execution
- Support for both sequential (pipeline) and parallel (fan-out/fan-in) patterns
- Clear task assignment and result aggregation
- Follows proven orchestration patterns from distributed systems

**Alternatives Considered**:
- State machine orchestration: Rejected due to complexity for dynamic workflows
- Event-driven orchestration: Rejected due to difficulty in error handling and recovery
- External workflow engine: Rejected due to external dependency constraints

## Research Summary

All NEEDS CLARIFICATION items have been resolved with decisions that:

1. **Leverage Agno Framework**: All solutions use built-in Agno capabilities
2. **Meet Performance Requirements**: Solutions support <5 minute execution times and <20% overhead
3. **Follow Constitution**: No external dependencies, uses framework directly
4. **Enable Testing**: All patterns support unit and integration testing
5. **Support Scale**: Can handle 3-5 agent teams effectively

The research provides a clear technical foundation for implementing multi-agent collaboration within the existing project structure and constraints.
