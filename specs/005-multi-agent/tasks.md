# Tasks: Multi-Agent Collaboration System

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/005-multi-agent/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

## Dependencies

**User Story Completion Order**:
1. **Setup + Foundational** (T001-T012) - Must complete before any user stories
2. **User Story 1** (T013-T022) - Research Team (independent, can start after foundational)
3. **User Story 2** (T023-T033) - Content Creation (independent, can start after foundational)
4. **User Story 3** (T034-T044) - Problem Solving (independent, can start after foundational)
5. **Polish** (T045-T054) - Cross-cutting improvements (requires all user stories)

**Critical Path**: Setup → Foundational → Any User Story → Polish

**Parallel Opportunities**:
- All [P] tasks can run in parallel within their phase
- User Stories 1, 2, and 3 can be developed in parallel after foundational phase
- Role implementations (T014-T016, T024-T026, T035-T037) can be developed in parallel
- Test creation tasks can run in parallel with implementation

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP Delivery (Minimum Viable Product)
**Scope**: Phase 1 + Phase 2 + User Story 1 (Research Team)
- **Rationale**: Research collaboration is the most fundamental use case
- **Deliverable**: Working research team that demonstrates core multi-agent collaboration
- **Timeline**: Focus on T001-T022 for initial release

### Incremental Delivery Plan
1. **Sprint 1**: Setup + Foundational (T001-T012)
2. **Sprint 2**: Research Team MVP (T013-T022)
3. **Sprint 3**: Content Creation Team (T023-T033)
4. **Sprint 4**: Problem-Solving Team (T034-T044)
5. **Sprint 5**: Polish & Performance (T045-T054)

### Validation Checkpoints
- **After Setup**: Basic module structure can be imported
- **After Foundational**: Core multi-agent classes instantiate without errors
- **After US1**: Research team produces coherent reports with multi-agent contributions
- **After US2**: Content creation shows clear collaboration between writer/editor agents
- **After US3**: Problem-solving demonstrates multiple perspectives in solution analysis
- **After Polish**: Performance meets <5 minutes for research tasks, <20% coordination overhead

### Quality Gates
- Each user story must pass independent testing before moving to next phase
- Performance requirements must be validated: 90% success rate, 5-minute completion
- Code coverage minimum 80% for core multi-agent infrastructure
- Integration tests must demonstrate successful agent communication and coordination
