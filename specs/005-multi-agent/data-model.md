# Data Model: Multi-Agent Collaboration System

**Feature**: Multi-Agent Collaboration System  
**Phase**: 1 - Design & Contracts  
**Date**: October 16, 2025

## Core Entities

### Multi-Agent Team

**Purpose**: A coordinated group of AI agents working together on shared objectives

**Attributes**:
- `team_id`: Unique identifier for the team instance
- `name`: Human-readable team name (e.g., "Research Team", "Content Creation Team")
- `team_type`: Type of collaboration (research, content_creation, problem_solving)
- `agents`: List of agent instances participating in the team
- `shared_context`: Common information accessible to all team members
- `workflow_state`: Current state of the collaboration workflow
- `created_at`: Team creation timestamp
- `status`: Current team status (active, completed, failed, paused)

**Validation Rules**:
- Team must have at least 2 agents
- Team must not exceed 5 agents (per performance requirements)
- Each agent in the team must have a unique role
- Team type must be one of the supported collaboration patterns

**State Transitions**:
- inactive → active (when team is initialized and ready)
- active → completed (when collaborative task succeeds)
- active → failed (when collaboration fails and cannot recover)
- active → paused (when collaboration is temporarily suspended)

### Agent Role

**Purpose**: Specialization definition that determines agent capabilities and responsibilities

**Attributes**:
- `role_id`: Unique identifier for the agent role
- `name`: Role name (e.g., "Researcher", "Analyst", "Writer", "Editor")
- `description`: Detailed role description and responsibilities
- `capabilities`: List of specific capabilities this role provides
- `tools`: Tool configurations specific to this role
- `instructions`: Role-specific prompt instructions
- `expertise_areas`: List of knowledge domains this role specializes in

**Validation Rules**:
- Role name must be unique within a team
- Capabilities list must not be empty
- Instructions must be provided for role specialization
- Expertise areas must align with role responsibilities

### Collaboration Workflow

**Purpose**: Orchestrated sequence of agent interactions and task handoffs

**Attributes**:
- `workflow_id`: Unique identifier for the workflow instance
- `workflow_type`: Type of workflow (sequential, parallel, hybrid)
- `steps`: Ordered list of workflow steps
- `current_step`: Currently executing step
- `task_assignments`: Mapping of tasks to specific agents
- `dependencies`: Inter-step dependencies and prerequisites
- `start_time`: Workflow execution start time
- `estimated_duration`: Expected workflow completion time
- `actual_duration`: Actual time taken for completion

**Validation Rules**:
- Workflow must have at least one step
- All dependencies must reference valid steps
- Task assignments must reference valid team agents
- Sequential workflows must have ordered step dependencies

**State Transitions**:
- pending → executing (when workflow starts)
- executing → completed (when all steps complete successfully)
- executing → failed (when workflow encounters unrecoverable error)
- executing → paused (when workflow is temporarily halted)

### Shared Context

**Purpose**: Information and state accessible to all agents in a collaboration

**Attributes**:
- `context_id`: Unique identifier for the shared context
- `team_id`: Reference to the owning team
- `data`: Key-value store of shared information
- `version`: Context version for consistency tracking
- `last_updated`: Timestamp of last modification
- `updated_by`: Agent that made the last update
- `access_log`: History of context access and modifications

**Validation Rules**:
- Context must belong to a valid team
- Version must increment with each update
- Access log must track all modifications
- Data must be serializable for persistence

### Agent Communication

**Purpose**: Mechanism for agents to exchange information and coordinate

**Attributes**:
- `message_id`: Unique identifier for the message
- `sender_agent`: Agent that sent the message
- `recipient_agents`: List of agents that should receive the message
- `message_type`: Type of message (information, request, response, coordination)
- `content`: Message content and payload
- `timestamp`: When the message was sent
- `priority`: Message priority level
- `requires_response`: Whether the message expects a response

**Validation Rules**:
- Sender and recipients must be valid team members
- Message type must be from predefined set
- Content must not be empty
- Priority must be valid priority level

### Task Assignment

**Purpose**: Distribution of work among agents based on roles and capacity

**Attributes**:
- `assignment_id`: Unique identifier for the task assignment
- `task_description`: Human-readable task description
- `assigned_agent`: Agent responsible for the task
- `task_type`: Type of task (research, analysis, synthesis, writing, editing)
- `dependencies`: Tasks that must complete before this task
- `estimated_effort`: Expected time or effort required
- `deadline`: Task completion deadline
- `status`: Current task status
- `result`: Task output or result

**Validation Rules**:
- Assigned agent must be valid team member
- Task type must align with agent role capabilities
- Dependencies must reference valid tasks
- Deadline must be after current time

**State Transitions**:
- assigned → in_progress (when agent starts working)
- in_progress → completed (when task finishes successfully)
- in_progress → blocked (when task cannot proceed due to dependencies)
- in_progress → failed (when task encounters error)

### Collaborative Output

**Purpose**: Integrated result combining individual agent contributions

**Attributes**:
- `output_id`: Unique identifier for the collaborative output
- `team_id`: Reference to the producing team
- `output_type`: Type of output (report, content, analysis, recommendations)
- `content`: Final integrated content
- `contributions`: List of individual agent contributions
- `quality_score`: Automated quality assessment score
- `completion_time`: Time taken to produce the output
- `metadata`: Additional output metadata and context

**Validation Rules**:
- Output must reference valid team
- Must include contributions from at least 2 agents
- Quality score must be within valid range
- Content must meet minimum length requirements

## Data Persistence Strategy

**Primary Storage**: In-memory objects during active collaboration
**Persistent Storage**: SQLite database for team history and results (following memory agent pattern)
**Shared State**: Agno framework's built-in session and context management
**Communication**: Event-driven message passing through Agno Team framework

This data model supports all functional requirements while maintaining consistency with the existing agent architecture and Agno framework patterns.
