    collaboration_rounds=5
)

# Start collaboration
results = team.collaborate()
print(f"Research Results: {results}")
```

## Core Examples

### Research Team Collaboration

**Purpose**: Coordinate multiple agents to research a complex topic

```python
# examples/multi_agents/research_team.py
from agno import Agent, Team

class ResearchTeam:
    def __init__(self, topic: str, team_size: int = 3):
        self.topic = topic
        self.team_size = team_size
        self.setup_team()
    
    def setup_team(self):
        # Create specialized agents
        self.researcher = Agent(
            name="Lead Researcher",
            role="primary_researcher",
            instructions=f"Research {self.topic} comprehensively",
            tools=["web_search", "academic_search"]
        )
        
        self.analyst = Agent(
            name="Data Analyst", 
            role="analyst",
            instructions="Analyze research data and identify patterns",
            tools=["data_analysis", "visualization"]
        )
        
        self.synthesizer = Agent(
            name="Research Synthesizer",
            role="synthesizer", 
            instructions="Combine findings into coherent conclusions",
            tools=["document_generation"]
        )
        
        # Create team
        self.team = Team([self.researcher, self.analyst, self.synthesizer])
    
    def collaborate(self):
        # Define workflow
        workflow = {
            "phase_1": "Initial research gathering",
            "phase_2": "Data analysis and validation", 
            "phase_3": "Synthesis and final report"
        }
        
        return self.team.run(
            task=f"Research and analyze {self.topic}",
            workflow=workflow,
            max_rounds=5
        )

# Usage
team = ResearchTeam("AI Ethics in Healthcare")
results = team.collaborate()
```

### Content Creation Team

**Purpose**: Create high-quality content through collaborative writing and editing

```python

from agno import Agent, Team

class ContentCreationTeam:
    def __init__(self, content_type: str, target_audience: str):
        self.content_type = content_type
        self.target_audience = target_audience
        self.setup_team()
    
    def setup_team(self):
        self.writer = Agent(
            name="Content Writer",
            role="writer",
            instructions=f"Write engaging {self.content_type} for {self.target_audience}",
            tools=["writing_tools", "research_tools"]
        )
        
        self.editor = Agent(
            name="Content Editor",
            role="editor", 
            instructions="Review, edit, and improve content quality",
            tools=["editing_tools", "grammar_check"]
        )
        
        self.reviewer = Agent(

            role="reviewer",
            instructions="Ensure content meets quality standards and objectives",
            tools=["quality_assessment"]
        )
        
        self.team = Team([self.writer, self.editor, self.reviewer])
    
    def create_content(self, brief: str):
        return self.team.run(
            task=f"Create {self.content_type}: {brief}",
            workflow={
                "draft": "Writer creates initial draft",
                "edit": "Editor refines and improves",
                "review": "Reviewer ensures quality"
            },
            quality_threshold=0.8
        )

            instructions="Create actionable implementation plans",
            tools=["project_planning", "task_breakdown"]
        )
        
        self.team = Team([self.analyzer, self.strategist, self.implementer])
    
    def solve_problem(self, problem_statement: str):
        return self.team.run(
            task=f"Solve: {problem_statement}",
            workflow={
                "analyze": "Break down the problem",
                "strategize": "Develop solution approaches",

        )

# Usage  
problem_team = ProblemSolvingTeam("business_optimization")
solution = problem_team.solve_problem("Reduce customer churn by 25%")
```

## Advanced Features

### Custom Workflow Orchestration

```python
from agno import Team, WorkflowManager

# Define custom workflow
workflow = WorkflowManager({
    "steps": [
        {"id": "research", "agent_role": "researcher", "parallel": False},
        {"id": "analyze", "agent_role": "analyst", "depends_on": ["research"]},
        {"id": "synthesize", "agent_role": "synthesizer", "depends_on": ["analyze"]},
        {"id": "review", "agent_role": "reviewer", "depends_on": ["synthesize"]}
    ],
    "quality_gates": [
        {"after": "research", "min_score": 0.7},
        {"after": "synthesize", "min_score": 0.8}
    ]
})

team = Team(agents, workflow=workflow)
```

### Shared Context Management

```python
from agno import SharedContext

# Create shared context for team collaboration
context = SharedContext({
    "project_goals": "Research sustainable energy",
    "timeline": "2 weeks",
    "quality_standards": {"min_sources": 10, "peer_review": True}
})

team = Team(agents, shared_context=context)
```

### Performance Monitoring

```python
# Monitor team performance
team.enable_monitoring(
    metrics=["collaboration_efficiency", "quality_scores", "time_to_completion"],
    alerts=["quality_drop", "deadline_risk"],
    dashboard=True
)

results = team.run(task)
print(f"Performance metrics: {team.get_metrics()}")
```

## Configuration Options

### Team Configuration

```python
team_config = {
    "max_agents": 5,
    "collaboration_timeout": 30,  # minutes
    "quality_threshold": 0.8,
    "auto_retry": True,
    "parallel_processing": True
}

team = Team(agents, config=team_config)
```

### Agent Specialization

```python
agent_config = {
    "role": "researcher",
    "expertise": ["academic_research", "data_analysis"],
    "tools": ["web_search", "academic_db", "citation_tools"],
    "working_style": "thorough",
    "collaboration_preference": "structured"
}

agent = Agent(name="Specialist", **agent_config)
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue**: Agents not communicating effectively
**Solution**: Check shared context configuration and ensure compatible agent roles

```python
# Verify agent compatibility
team.validate_agent_compatibility()

# Enable debug logging
team.enable_debug_logging()
```

**Issue**: Quality thresholds not met
**Solution**: Adjust quality criteria or provide additional context

```python
# Lower quality threshold temporarily
team.config.quality_threshold = 0.7

# Provide more detailed instructions
agent.update_instructions("Be more thorough in analysis...")
```

**Issue**: Workflow timing out
**Solution**: Increase timeout or optimize workflow steps

```python
# Increase timeout
team.config.collaboration_timeout = 60

# Optimize workflow
workflow.optimize_parallel_execution()
```

### Debug and Monitoring

```python
# Enable comprehensive logging
import logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)

# Monitor real-time collaboration
team.start_monitoring()
results = team.run(task)
team.stop_monitoring()

# Review collaboration history
history = team.get_collaboration_history()
team.generate_performance_report()
```

## Best Practices  

1. **Role Specialization**: Give each agent clear, non-overlapping responsibilities
2. **Quality Gates**: Implement quality checkpoints throughout workflows
3. **Context Sharing**: Maintain clear shared context for coordination
4. **Iterative Improvement**: Use feedback loops to improve collaboration
5. **Resource Management**: Monitor and optimize resource usage
