# Reasoning Agent Specification

## Feature Overview
Build a reasoning AI agent that performs step-by-step problem analysis with structured thinking. The agent breaks down complex problems, shows reasoning steps, provides logical analysis, and presents solutions in a clear, structured format. Features intermediate step streaming for real-time reasoning visibility.

## User Stories
- As a user, I want to get help with complex problem-solving that requires structured analysis
- As a user, I want to see the agent's reasoning process step-by-step as it works
- As a user, I want the agent to break down complex problems into manageable components
- As a developer, I want reasoning patterns that can be applied to various problem domains
- As a user, I want the agent to identify assumptions and highlight uncertainties
- As a user, I want multiple perspectives considered in the analysis
- As a user, I want clear, structured presentation of solutions and recommendations

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Agent integrates ReasoningTools using Agno's tool system
- [ ] Complex problems are automatically broken down into component parts
- [ ] Step-by-step reasoning process is visible to users
- [ ] Agent identifies and states assumptions clearly
- [ ] Multiple perspectives are considered for complex issues
- [ ] Areas of uncertainty are highlighted and explained
- [ ] Reasoning steps are streamed in real-time (stream_intermediate_steps=True)
- [ ] Solutions are presented with clear logic and supporting evidence
- [ ] Agent handles problems requiring different reasoning patterns (deductive, inductive, abductive)
- [ ] Response quality maintains high analytical standards
