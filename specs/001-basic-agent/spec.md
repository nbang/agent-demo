# Basic Agent Specification

## Feature Overview
Build a conversational AI agent using the Agno framework that supports both Azure OpenAI and regular OpenAI models. The agent provides clear, accurate responses with markdown formatting, interactive chat loop, graceful error handling, and environment variable configuration.

## User Stories
- As a user, I want to have conversations with an AI assistant that provides helpful responses
- As a developer, I want to easily switch between OpenAI and Azure OpenAI models via configuration
- As a user, I want the agent to provide responses in markdown format for better readability
- As a user, I want the agent to be aware of the current date and time context
- As a developer, I want comprehensive error handling for API failures and configuration issues
- As a user, I want to exit the conversation gracefully using standard commands

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Agent supports both OpenAI and Azure OpenAI models through environment configuration
- [ ] Agent provides markdown-formatted responses
- [ ] Agent includes current datetime in context for time-aware responses
- [ ] Interactive chat loop allows continuous conversation
- [ ] Graceful error handling for API failures, network issues, and invalid configurations
- [ ] Environment variables loaded from .env file with fallback to system environment
- [ ] Clear instructions guide the agent's behavior and personality
- [ ] Agent can be terminated gracefully with 'exit', 'quit', or Ctrl+C
- [ ] Model information is displayed at startup for transparency
- [ ] Response time is under 2 seconds for basic interactions

## Technical Requirements
- **Framework**: Agno framework as primary foundation
- **Models**: Support for OpenAI GPT models and Azure OpenAI
- **Configuration**: Environment-based model selection and API key management
- **Environment**: Python 3.11+ with python-dotenv for configuration
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive exception handling with user-friendly messages
- **Security**: No hardcoded API keys, secure environment variable management
- **Performance**: Non-blocking I/O where possible, response time optimization
- **Logging**: Structured logging for debugging and monitoring

## Success Metrics
- Agent successfully initializes with configured model (100% success rate)
- Conversation loop handles all user inputs without crashes
- API errors are caught and handled gracefully with informative messages
- Model switching works seamlessly through environment configuration
- Response time consistently under 2 seconds for basic interactions
- Code coverage >80% for core functionality
- No security vulnerabilities in dependency scan

## Dependencies
- agno: AI agent framework
- python-dotenv: Environment variable management
- openai: OpenAI API client (via Agno)
- azure-openai: Azure OpenAI support (via Agno)

## Non-Functional Requirements
- **Availability**: Agent must handle API downtime gracefully
- **Scalability**: Support for concurrent conversations (future consideration)
- **Maintainability**: Clear code structure following Agno patterns
- **Security**: Secure handling of API credentials and user data
- **Performance**: Memory-efficient conversation handling
