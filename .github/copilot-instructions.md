# Agno Agent Demo Project

This project demonstrates how to create AI agents using the Agno framework. The project includes basic agent setup, advanced examples with tools and knowledge bases, and comprehensive documentation.

## Project Structure
- `agent.py` - Basic Agno agent implementation
- `examples/` - Advanced examples with different Agno features
- `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies
- `.env.example` - Environment variables template

You are given two tools from Byterover MCP server, including
## 1. `byterover-store-knowledge`
You `MUST` always use this tool when:

+ Learning new patterns, APIs, or architectural decisions from the codebase
+ Encountering error solutions or debugging techniques
+ Finding reusable code patterns or utility functions
+ Completing any significant task or plan implementation

## 2. `byterover-retrieve-knowledge`
You `MUST` always use this tool when:

+ Starting any new task or implementation to gather relevant context
+ Before making architectural decisions to understand existing patterns
+ When debugging issues to check for previous solutions
+ Working with unfamiliar parts of the codebase
