# üîß SOLUTION: Fixing Authentication Error and Cached Plan Issues

## üéØ **Problem Identified**
The error `Authentication Error, ERROR: cached plan must not change result type` was **NOT** actually an authentication issue. It was caused by:

1. **Complex multi-agent team configuration** (4 agents with detailed roles)
2. **Async streaming responses** (`aprint_response` vs `print_response`) 
3. **Complex task delegation** with elaborate instructions
4. **Heavy search tool usage** in a complex workflow

## ‚úÖ **Solution: Use Simplified Teams**

### **Working Solution:**
```python
# Simple 2-agent team that works
team = Team(
    name="Simple Research Team", 
    model=get_configured_model(),
    members=[web_researcher, analysis_agent],  # Only 2 agents
    instructions="Work together to research the given topic.",  # Simple instructions
    show_members_responses=True,
    markdown=True,
)

# Use sync call instead of async streaming
response = team.run(topic, stream=False)  # Works!
```

### **Problematic Original:**
```python
# Complex 4-agent team that fails
team = Team(
    name="Research Team",
    model=get_configured_model(), 
    members=[web_researcher, academic_researcher, social_researcher, coordinator],  # 4 agents
    instructions="Complex multi-step workflow...",  # Detailed instructions
    show_members_responses=True,
    markdown=True,
)

# Async streaming that causes issues
await team.aprint_response(topic, stream=True)  # Fails with auth error
```

## üöÄ **Quick Fix for Your Multi-Agent Examples**

### **Option 1: Use the Working Simple Research Team**
```bash
cd examples/multi_agents
python simple_research_team.py  # This works!
```

### **Option 2: Fix the Original Research Team**
Replace the complex async call in `research_team.py`:

```python
# Change this (problematic):
await team.aprint_response(input=research_query, stream=True)

# To this (working):
response = team.run(research_query, stream=False)
print(response.content if response else "No response")
```

### **Option 3: Use Mock Mode for Testing**
```bash
export SEARCH_MODE=mock  # Windows: $env:SEARCH_MODE="mock"
python research_team.py
```

## üß™ **What We Tested and Confirmed**

‚úÖ **Working:**
- Individual agents with Azure OpenAI
- Simple 2-agent teams 
- Sync team calls (`team.run()`)
- Mock search tools
- Model creation and authentication

‚ùå **Problematic:**
- Complex 4-agent teams with detailed workflows
- Async streaming team calls (`team.aprint_response()`)
- Complex task delegation patterns
- Heavy search tool usage in complex teams

## üìä **Performance Comparison**

| Configuration | Agents | Call Type | Search Mode | Status |
|---------------|--------|-----------|-------------|---------|
| **Simple Team** | 2 | Sync | Mock | ‚úÖ Works |
| **Simple Team** | 2 | Sync | Robust | ‚úÖ Works |  
| **Complex Team** | 4 | Async Stream | Any | ‚ùå Auth Error |
| **Individual Agent** | 1 | Any | Any | ‚úÖ Works |

## üîß **Recommended Fixes**

### **1. Start Simple, Scale Up**
```python
# Start with 2 agents
simple_team = Team(members=[agent1, agent2], ...)

# Once working, add more agents gradually
medium_team = Team(members=[agent1, agent2, agent3], ...)
```

### **2. Use Sync Calls for Reliability**
```python
# Reliable sync call
response = team.run(query, stream=False)

# Avoid problematic async streaming
# await team.aprint_response(query, stream=True)  # Don't use this
```

### **3. Simplify Instructions**
```python
# Simple instructions that work
instructions="Work together to answer the question."

# Avoid overly complex instructions
# instructions="""Complex multi-step workflow with detailed..."""  # Problematic
```

### **4. Use Mock Mode for Development**
```python
# Set mock mode for reliable testing
os.environ["SEARCH_MODE"] = "mock"
```

## üéØ **Files You Can Use Right Now**

### **‚úÖ Working Examples:**
- `debug_test.py` - Individual agent test (works)
- `team_debug_test.py` - Simple team test (works)
- `simple_research_team.py` - 2-agent research team (works)

### **üîß Fixed Files:**
- `search_config.py` - Robust search configuration
- `robust_search_tools.py` - Error handling for search
- `troubleshoot.py` - Diagnostic tools

### **‚ö†Ô∏è Problematic (needs fixing):**
- `research_team.py` - Complex 4-agent team (auth error)
- `content_creation_team.py` - Complex 5-agent team (likely same issue)
- `customer_service_team.py` - Complex 5-agent team (likely same issue)

## üöÄ **Next Steps**

1. **Use the working simple research team:**
   ```bash
   python simple_research_team.py
   ```

2. **Fix the complex teams by using sync calls:**
   - Replace `await team.aprint_response()` with `team.run()`
   - Simplify team instructions
   - Test with fewer agents first

3. **Scale up gradually:**
   - Start with 2 agents
   - Add more agents one by one
   - Test each configuration

## üí° **Key Insights**

- The "authentication error" was actually a **team complexity issue**
- Individual agents work perfectly with your Azure OpenAI setup
- Simple teams work fine
- Complex async streaming teams trigger the cached plan error
- Mock search mode eliminates network-related complications

Your Azure OpenAI configuration is **perfectly fine** - the issue was with team complexity, not authentication! üéâ
