## ðŸŽ¯ Key Multi-Agent Patterns Demonstrated

### **Specialization**
Each agent has distinct expertise and tools:
- Different knowledge domains
- Specialized tool access (web search, reasoning, etc.)
- Role-specific instructions and behavior

### **Collaboration** 
Agents work together towards common goals:
- Information sharing between agents
- Building on each other's work
- Coordinated problem-solving

### **Workflow**
Structured processes with clear handoffs:
- Sequential task execution
- Quality control stages
- Review and refinement cycles

### **Escalation**
Hierarchical handling of complex cases:
- Triage and routing systems
- Specialist consultation
- Management oversight

## ðŸ“Š Example Output

When you run these examples, you'll see:
- **Individual agent responses** with specialized expertise
- **Team coordination** and task delegation
- **Comprehensive final outputs** combining all perspectives
- **Source citations** and reference materials
- **Interactive prompts** for user input and customization

## ðŸ”§ Customization

Each example can be customized by:
- **Modifying agent instructions** for different domains
- **Adding new specialized agents** to teams
- **Changing collaboration patterns** and workflows  
- **Integrating additional tools** and capabilities
- **Adjusting output formats** and structures

## ðŸ’¡ Technical Architecture

### **Team Structure**
```python
team = Team(
    name="Team Name",
    model=get_configured_model(),
    members=[agent1, agent2, agent3],
    instructions="Team coordination instructions",
    show_members_responses=True,  # Show individual contributions
    markdown=True,
)
```

### **Agent Configuration**
```python
agent = Agent(
    name="Agent Name",
    role="Agent's specific role",
    model=get_configured_model(),
    tools=[DuckDuckGoTools(), ReasoningTools()],
    instructions="Detailed role-specific instructions",
    add_name_to_context=True,
    markdown=True,
)
```

## ðŸ“‹ Environment Variables Required

Make sure your `.env` file includes:
```bash
# Azure OpenAI (if using Azure)
AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your_azure_key
AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=your_azure_endpoint
OPENAI_MODEL_NAME=your_model_name

# Or Standard OpenAI
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Best Practices

1. **Clear Role Definition**: Each agent should have distinct, well-defined responsibilities
2. **Appropriate Tool Selection**: Match tools to agent capabilities and needs
3. **Effective Instructions**: Provide detailed, actionable guidance for each agent
4. **Team Coordination**: Use clear team-level instructions for collaboration
5. **Output Management**: Structure responses for clarity and usefulness

## ðŸš¦ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:
- **API Key Errors**: Check your `.env` file configuration
- **Import Errors**: Ensure all dependencies are installed
- **Model Access**: Verify your model permissions and quotas
- **Tool Limitations**: Some tools may have rate limits or usage restrictions

### Getting Help:
- Check the main project `README.md` for setup instructions
- Review `model_config.py` for configuration options
- Test individual agents before running full teams
- Monitor API usage and costs during development
