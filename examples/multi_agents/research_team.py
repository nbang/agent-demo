Multi-Agent Research Team Example

This example demonstrates a collaborative team of specialized research agents
working together to provide comprehensive analysis on any topic.

Team Members:
- Web Researcher: Searches current web information
- Academic Researcher: Finds scholarly articles and papers  
- Social Media Researcher: Tracks trends and discussions
- Analysis Coordinator: Synthesizes findings and provides final report
