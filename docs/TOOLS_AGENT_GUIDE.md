Use the `stats` or `performance` command during chat to view current metrics.

## Usage Tips

### Best Practices
1. **Be Specific**: Provide clear, specific requests for better results
2. **Use Examples**: When asking for calculations, provide the exact expression
3. **Check Paths**: Verify file paths exist before requesting file operations
4. **Start Simple**: Begin with basic operations before complex workflows

### Common Workflows

#### **File Analysis Workflow**
1. List directory contents: `"List files in the project directory"`
2. Get file information: `"Get details about setup.py"`
3. Read file contents: `"Read the first 50 lines of main.py"`

#### **System Monitoring Workflow**
1. Check system info: `"Show system information"`
2. Monitor resources: `"What's the current CPU and memory usage?"`
3. Run diagnostics: `"Run the command: python --version"`

#### **Research Workflow**
1. Search for information: `"Search for Python best practices 2024"`
2. Get current data: `"What's today's date?"`
3. Calculate metrics: `"Calculate the percentage: 75/100 * 100"`

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Import Errors**
```bash
# Make sure you're in the project directory
cd /path/to/agent-demo

# Check Python path
python -c "import sys; print(sys.path)"
```

**Permission Errors**
- Ensure read permissions for files you want to access
- Run with appropriate user permissions
- Check file ownership and permissions

**Tool Not Found**
- Verify all dependencies are installed: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Check that the Agno framework is properly installed
- Ensure environment variables are set correctly

**Performance Issues**
- Monitor system resources with the `stats` command
- Reduce file reading limits with `max_lines` parameter
- Use more specific search queries to reduce processing time

### Getting Help

During a chat session, you can:
- Type `help` for usage examples
- Type `stats` for performance information
- Type `quit` or `exit` to end the session

The agent provides helpful error messages and suggestions when issues occur.

src/models/config.py         # Model configuration
```

### Tool Implementation
- Each tool is implemented as a decorated function using `@tool`
- Tools are automatically registered with the agent
- Comprehensive error handling and logging
- Security-first design with input validation

### Agent Configuration
- Multi-model support (OpenAI, Azure OpenAI)
- Streaming response capability
- Context-aware processing
- Markdown formatting support

This tool agent represents a production-ready example of building sophisticated AI agents with practical capabilities while maintaining security and reliability.

## Next Steps

To extend the tool agent:

1. **Add New Tools**: Implement additional `@tool` decorated functions
2. **Enhance Security**: Add more sophisticated input validation
3. **Expand APIs**: Integrate with additional external services
4. **Improve Performance**: Add caching and optimization features
5. **Add Persistence**: Implement session memory and data storage

The modular architecture makes it easy to add new capabilities while maintaining the existing functionality.
