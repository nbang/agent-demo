3. Determine critical components requiring priority attention
4. Consider how solving one part affects others
5. Establish logical sequence for addressing each component
```

### **Evidence Evaluation Pattern**
```python
# Systematic assessment of information
1. Identify sources and types of available evidence
2. Evaluate credibility and reliability of each source
3. Look for both supporting and contradicting evidence
4. Assess strength of claimed causal relationships
5. Consider what additional evidence would strengthen analysis
```

### **Multi-Perspective Analysis**
```python
# Comprehensive stakeholder consideration
1. Identify key stakeholders and their interests
2. Consider how different groups might view the problem
3. Analyze potential conflicts between perspectives
4. Look for common ground and shared interests
5. Evaluate which perspectives have the strongest foundation
```
