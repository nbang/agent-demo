python memory_agent.py
```

### **Programmatic Usage**
```python
from src.agents.memory import create_memory_agent

# Create memory agent with default database
agent = create_memory_agent()

# Create memory agent with custom database
agent = create_memory_agent(db_file="my_custom_memory.db")

# Use the agent
response = agent.run("Hello, I'm Alex and I work as a software developer")
```

## üìä Memory Architecture

### **Database Structure**

- Data minimization principles
- Local storage with user control
```

## üí° Usage Examples

### **First-Time Interaction Setup**
```
üë§ You: Hi, I'm Sarah and I'm a product manager at a tech startup. 
       I prefer concise answers and I'm working on AI integration projects.

üß† Memory Assistant: Thanks Sarah! I've noted that you're a product manager 
    at a tech startup, prefer concise answers, and are working on AI 
    integration projects. This helps me tailor my responses to your needs.
    
    What specific aspects of AI integration are you exploring?

[The agent automatically stores this context for future conversations]
```

### **Contextual Recall in Later Sessions**
```
üë§ You: What did we discuss about my AI project last time?

üß† Memory Assistant: I remember you're Sarah, a product manager working on 
    AI integration projects at your tech startup. You mentioned exploring 
    AI integration - did you want to continue discussing implementation 
    strategies, or have you moved on to a specific aspect like vendor 
    evaluation or team training?

[Agent recalls previous context and asks relevant follow-up questions]
```

### **Building Long-Term Context**
```
üë§ You: I've decided to focus on chatbot integration first.

üß† Memory Assistant: Great choice! Given your product management background 
    and preference for concise information, here are the key decision points 
    for chatbot integration...
    
    [Updates memory: AI project ‚Üí specifically chatbot integration]

[Later conversation...]

üë§ You: How's that chatbot project progressing?

üß† Memory Assistant: You mentioned focusing on chatbot integration for your 
    AI project. Have you made progress on the implementation strategy we 
    discussed, or do you need help with a specific challenge?
```

## üîß Configuration Options

### **Database Configuration**
```python

.schema agno_memories    # Show memory table structure
```

## üö® Troubleshooting

### **Common Issues**

#### **Database Connection Issues**
```
Error: Failed to initialize memory database

Solutions:
1. Check file permissions in project directory
2. Ensure SQLite is properly installed
3. Verify disk space availability
4. Check for corrupted database file
```

#### **Memory Not Persisting**
```
Issue: Agent doesn't remember previous conversations

Solutions:
1. Verify database file exists and has data:
   ls -la agent_memory.db
2. Check if enable_agentic_memory=True is set
3. Ensure agent is properly saving before exit
4. Verify database isn't being recreated each time
```

#### **Slow Memory Operations**
```
Issue: Memory queries taking >2 seconds

Solutions:
1. Check database size (large databases may be slower)
2. Verify available system memory
3. Consider database optimization or cleanup
4. Monitor concurrent database access
```

#### **Import Errors**
```
Error: Import "src.agents.memory" could not be resolved

Solutions:
1. Ensure you're running from project root directory
2. Check Python path includes project root
3. Verify all dependencies are installed:
   pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### **Performance Optimization**

#### **Database Maintenance**
```python
# Manual database optimization (if needed)
import sqlite3

conn = sqlite3.connect('agent_memory.db')
conn.execute('VACUUM')  # Optimize database file
conn.execute('ANALYZE') # Update query planner statistics
conn.close()
```

#### **Memory Management**
```python
# Monitor memory usage patterns
from src.agents.memory import get_memory_stats

stats = get_memory_stats()
print(f"Database size: {stats['database_size_mb']} MB")
print(f"Success rate: {stats['success_rate']}%")
```

## üîç Advanced Usage

### **Custom Memory Strategies**
```python
# Access the memory manager directly
from src.agents.memory import get_memory_manager

manager = get_memory_manager("custom_memory.db")
agent = manager.create_memory_agent()

# Get detailed statistics
stats = manager.get_memory_statistics()
print(f"Total operations: {stats['total_operations']}")
```

### **Memory Pattern Implementation**
```python
# Understand how memory patterns work
from src.agents.memory import MemoryPatterns

# Each pattern provides specific instructions
conversation_patterns = MemoryPatterns.get_conversation_memory_instructions()
user_patterns = MemoryPatterns.get_user_context_instructions()
privacy_patterns = MemoryPatterns.get_privacy_instructions()

# These are automatically integrated into the agent instructions
```

### **Integration with Other Agents**
```python
# Combine memory with other capabilities
from src.agents.memory import create_memory_agent
from agno.tools.duckduckgo import DuckDuckGoTools

# Create memory agent with additional tools
agent = create_memory_agent()
# Note: Additional tools would need to be added during agent creation
```

## üìù Best Practices

### **Effective Memory Usage**
1. **Be Specific**: Share detailed context about your background and needs
2. **State Preferences**: Clearly communicate your communication style preferences
3. **Reference History**: Ask about previous conversations to test memory recall
4. **Provide Feedback**: Let the agent know when it remembers context correctly
5. **Regular Interaction**: Consistent use helps build better contextual understanding

### **Privacy Management**
