- Risk and mitigation planning

**Example:** "How would you solve traffic congestion in a major city?"

### **Strategic Decision Making**
For business and organizational decisions:
- Decision criteria establishment
- Option evaluation and ranking
- Risk assessment and management
- Implementation planning

**Example:** "Should a startup focus on growth or profitability in its first year?"

### **Causal Analysis**
For understanding relationships and causes:
- Evidence quality assessment
- Alternative explanation consideration
- Causal mechanism evaluation
- Confidence level assessment

**Example:** "Why are housing prices increasing in major cities?"

## Reasoning Patterns

### **Problem Decomposition Pattern**
```
1. Break down complex problems into fundamental components
2. Identify relationships between different parts
3. Determine critical components requiring priority attention
4. Consider how solving one part affects others
5. Establish logical sequence for addressing each component
```

### **Evidence Evaluation Pattern**
```
1. Identify sources and types of available evidence
2. Evaluate credibility and reliability of each source
3. Look for both supporting and contradicting evidence
4. Assess strength of claimed causal relationships
5. Consider what additional evidence would strengthen analysis
```

### **Assumption Analysis Pattern**
```
1. State what information is being taken as given
2. Identify unstated assumptions underlying the problem
3. Evaluate how reasonable these assumptions are
4. Consider what changes if assumptions prove incorrect
5. Highlight which assumptions are most critical to validate
```

### **Uncertainty Handling Pattern**
```
1. Clearly identify what is known vs. unknown
2. Distinguish between different types of uncertainty
3. Assess potential impact of unknown factors
4. Consider scenarios with different uncertainty outcomes
5. Recommend strategies for reducing uncertainty where possible
```

## Usage Tips

### **For Best Results:**
1. **Ask Complex Questions**: The agent excels with multi-faceted problems requiring deep analysis
2. **Be Specific**: Provide context and specific aspects you want analyzed
3. **Request Specific Approaches**: Ask for particular reasoning patterns when needed
4. **Follow Up**: Build on previous analyses with deeper questions

### **Example Effective Prompts:**
```
✅ "Analyze the pros and cons of remote work, considering productivity, 
   employee wellbeing, company culture, and long-term business impact."

✅ "What factors should a city consider when deciding between investing 
   in public transportation vs. electric vehicle infrastructure?"

✅ "Examine the ethical implications of using AI for hiring decisions, 
   considering fairness, efficiency, and legal considerations."
```

### **Less Effective Prompts:**
```
❌ "Is remote work good?" (too simple, lacks complexity)
❌ "What do you think about AI?" (too broad, no specific focus)
❌ "Help me decide something." (lacks context and specifics)
```
