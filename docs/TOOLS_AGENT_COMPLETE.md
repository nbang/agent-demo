    """List contents of a directory with detailed information."""

@tool  
def read_file(file_path: str, max_lines: int = 100) -> str:
    """Read contents of a text file safely."""

@tool
def get_file_info(file_path: str) -> str:
    """Get detailed information about a file or directory."""
```

### **System Information Tools**
```python
@tool
def get_system_info() -> str:
    """Get comprehensive system information."""

@tool
def run_command(command: str, timeout: int = 30) -> str:
    """Run a safe system command."""
```

@tool
def calculate(expression: str) -> str:
    """Safely evaluate mathematical expressions."""
```

### **Date/Time Tools**
```python
@tool
def get_current_datetime(timezone: Optional[str] = None) -> str:
    """Get current date and time information."""

@tool
def parse_datetime(date_string: str, format_string: Optional[str] = None) -> str:

## 🎉 **Usage Examples**

### **Interactive Sessions**
```
👤 You: Search for the latest Python news
🤖 Assistant: I'll search for the latest Python news for you.
[Uses DuckDuckGo search and provides formatted results]

👤 You: List files in the current directory  
🤖 Assistant: I'll list the contents of the current directory.
[Uses list_directory tool and shows formatted file listings]

👤 You: Calculate the area of a circle with radius 5
🤖 Assistant: I'll calculate that for you.
[Uses calculate tool: pi * 5**2 = 78.54]

👤 You: What's the current system information?
🤖 Assistant: Let me get the current system information.
[Uses get_system_info and displays comprehensive system details]
```

### **Multiple Execution Methods**
