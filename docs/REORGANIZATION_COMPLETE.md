# Project Reorganization Complete

## Summary

The Agno Agent Demo project has been successfully reorganized into a clean, modular directory structure following Python best practices and the enhanced project specifications.

## Changes Made

### Directory Structure
- Created `src/` directory as the main source code container
- Organized code into logical subdirectories:
  - `src/agents/` - Agent implementations
  - `src/models/` - Model configuration and management
  - `src/services/` - Supporting services (performance monitoring, etc.)
  - `src/lib/` - Utilities and common functionality

### File Relocations
- `agent.py` → `src/agents/basic.py` (enhanced main agent)
- `model_config.py` → `src/models/config.py`
- `error_handling.py` → `src/lib/error_handling.py`
- `performance_monitor.py` → `src/services/performance_monitor.py`
- `logging_config.py` → `src/lib/logging_config.py`

### New Entry Point
- Created new `agent.py` in project root as a simple entry point
- Handles proper import paths and launches the main agent
- Maintains backward compatibility for users

### Package Structure
- Added `__init__.py` files to all subdirectories
- Configured proper exports for each module
- Updated all import statements to use new package structure

### Import Updates
- Updated all internal imports to use the new `src.` package structure
- Fixed circular import issues
- Ensured all modules can find their dependencies correctly

## Project Status

✅ **Complete** - All 8 implementation tasks from the Basic Agent specification
✅ **Complete** - Directory reorganization to match enhanced specifications  
✅ **Complete** - Import path updates and package structure
✅ **Complete** - Entry point creation and testing
✅ **Verified** - All modules import successfully
✅ **Verified** - Agent runs and functions correctly

## Usage

The project can now be run in multiple ways:

1. **Simple entry point**: `python agent.py`
2. **Module execution**: `python -m src.agents.basic`
3. **Direct import**: `from src.agents.basic import main; main()`

All methods work correctly and provide the same enhanced agent functionality with comprehensive error handling, performance monitoring, and security features.

## Next Steps

The project is now production-ready with:
- Clean, modular architecture
- Comprehensive error handling
- Performance monitoring
- Security features
- Proper package structure
- Multiple execution methods
- Complete documentation

Ready for deployment, further development, or integration into larger systems.
